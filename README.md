# experiment-playwright-import-json-v1.29.1
This Experiment branch is here to illustrate the problem with playwright when fails to import json files for transpiled typeScript code when type=module.

## UPDATE
This was fixed with the release of [playwright@1.30.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.30.0).
